# flap

Flap began as a dream to bring imagination to life. Originally envisioned as a manga where each character had unique powers inspired by TV, comics, and anime, the idea evolved into something even more immersive — a virtual playground where players become the characters. Blending gamified mechanics with an anime-inspired aesthetic, Flap invites teens, students, and artists to create, explore, and express their inner worlds through interactive VR experiences. It’s not just an app — it’s your imagination in motion.
